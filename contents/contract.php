 <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>
           I, Stephane Pandry agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER 2024, Web 250 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. (Note - Donâ€™t use the caps- but replace those with your data, with normal letter casing)
      
            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
      
           I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
